# Contributing guidelines

## In general
- Some repositories will have contributing guidelines here: others won't.
- Read the guidelines and follow them. This will give your PR a better chance of being accepted.
- Some repositories want you to open an issue first, in order to discuss your proposed change.
This can be a good approach even if it isn't required, so that you know whether the owner agrees with your suggestion,
and might bring up ideas and/or challenges you haven't considered.
- There may also be directions about code style, testing, version numbers etc.

## Contributing to this repository
Thanks for reading this, and for contributing to this repository!
### What changes should I make?
- It doesn't really matter what changes you make to the repository; this is just so you can make a pull request.
- The initial idea was to add your paper from the lesson - copy and paste your paper into this repo.
- Some past contributors took the opportunity to showcase their sense of humour. Feel free to do the same; go on, make me laugh!
- You could edit one of the existing files e.g. 
  - fix a typo
  - convert a plain text `.txt` file to a markdown `.md` file
  
### Style
  Please follow the advice on [how to write a good commit message](http://gcapes.github.io/git-course/04-commit-advice/).
  
### What should I expect after submitting a pull request?
- As the owner of the repository, I'll get a notification of your pull request. 
- If I like your pull request, I'll merge it, which should trigger an email notification for you.
- I might comment on your pull request.
- Apologies, but due to time constraints I might have to close your PR without even looking at it or commenting.
