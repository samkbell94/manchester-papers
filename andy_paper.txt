Title:
Measurements and simulations of secondary organic aerosols from BVOC

Abstract:
We present here findings from a model-measurement comparison study.

Introduction:
This paper presents measurements of 
secondary organic aerosols, formed from
biological VOC emissions.
J. Bloggs et al 2010 have made some lovely measurements
but they haven't answered question X about the
science.
J. Smith et al 2011 attempted to investigate question X,
but further work is needed.
A. Jones et al 2013 also claimed to answer question X,
but we don't believe that they have done.

Methodology:
A state of the art aerosol mass spectrometer was used to measure
chemical composition and mass concentrations, as described in
Allen et al 2004.

Simulations:
Simulations of SOA were made using an atmospheric
model.

Results:
The simulations did a fair job of approximating the measurements.

Conclusions:
We found out some stuff. Splendid. Science has advanced,
but we haven't stopped yet.

Acknowledgements:
We would like to thank the EU funding body for their support,
which we may never receive again if things continue the way
they are going.
