# Title
Cryo-EM & Tomography of Matrix Proteins and their Niche

# Abstract
Abstracts are hard to write. That is why we write this at the end.

# Introduction section
Cryo-EM is a method that has recently won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. It is used to look at individual protein molecules. The work by Richard Henderson was vital to the atomic resolution of structures generated Henderson et al (2004). Dubouchet et al (2001) were instrumental for the freezing of single particle proteins using liquid ethane.

# Simulations
Molecular dynamic simulations were used to identify the most reasonable conformation of the protein withregards to the volume from EM.

# Methodology
We use CNS to do the MD simulations using torsion angle MD, although using GPU accelerated GROMAS (Lindahl et al 2005) with REMD may be better.

# Results
It was possible to accurately obtain the structure of BMPER using the MD and cryo-EM

# Conclusion
The structure of BMPER was obtained using a combination of cryo-EM and MD with a resolution of 3.8 Angstroms.
